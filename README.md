# Repository Organization

* [Benchmarks](Benchmarks): Provides source code and tuning space definitions (problem.py) for all benchmarks.
Organized by benchmark suite, then benchmark.
* [ConditionalSampling](ConditionalSampling): Greater depth presentation and exploration of mathematics and mechanisms of Conditional Sampling with Gaussian Copulas.
Provided as an additional resource referenced by the paper.
* [Data](Data): Raw experimental data provided for transparency.
Files are organized by benchmark suite, benchmark, then each tuning technique.
* [GC\_TLA](GC_TLA): Our technique as well as all scripts necessary to replicate our experiments and analyses.

# Setup and Installation

* After cloning, run `python3 softLinkDataDirs.py` to establish symbolic links between respective entries of the Benchmarks and Data directories.
